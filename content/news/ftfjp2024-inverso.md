Abstract:

> As software systems become more and more pervasive and sophisticated, their
vulnerabilities are exploited at increasingly worrisome speeds. Static analysis
can detect a variety of flaws, including different security-related issues, at
an early stage in the software development process.  
We introduce the topic by discussing different perspectives, from increased
lawmaker awareness and upcoming bureaucratic regulations, to coding standards
and vulnerability databases.  
We then focus on the problem of data race detection with a novel static
technique for C programs with POSIX threads. The key element of the technique
is a reduction to reachability that can be combined with bounded model checking
and context-bounded analysis for great detection accuracy.
This talk includes joint work with Emerson Sales, Emilio Tuosto, and Rocco De
Nicola.

Bio:

> Omar Inverso is a tenure-track assistant professor at the Gran Sasso
Science Institute in L'Aquila, Italy. His research interests include formal
