From the conference Web page:

> The ACM SIGBED International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT) brings
together researchers and developers from academia, industry, and government to
advance the science, engineering, and technology of embedded software
development. Since 2001, EMSOFT has been the premier venue for cutting-edge
research in the design and analysis of software that interacts with physical
processes, with a long-standing tradition for results on cyber-physical
systems, which compose computation, networking, and physical dynamics.
