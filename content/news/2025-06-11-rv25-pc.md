The 25th International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV'25) will take
place in Graz, Austria from September 15 to September 19, 2025.

From the conference's Web page:

> Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the
runtime behavior of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification
techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness;
they provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to
conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal
verification.
Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment, for testing,
verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring
reliability, safety, and security and for providing fault containment and
recovery as well as online system repair.
