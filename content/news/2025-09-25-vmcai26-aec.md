title: "I have joined the [VMCAI'26](https://conf.researchr.org/home/VMCAI-2026) artifact evaluation committee."

From the conference's call for papers:

> VMCAI provides a forum for researchers from the communities of Verification,
Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating interaction,
cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that combine these and
related areas. 

From the call for artifacts:

> VMCAI 2026 makes available the option to submit an artifact along with
a paper. Artifacts are any additional material that substantiates the claims
made in the paper, and ideally makes them fully replicable. For some papers,
these artifacts are as important as the paper itself because they provide
crucial evidence for the quality of the results. The goal of artifact
evaluation is twofold. On the one hand, we want to encourage authors to provide
more substantial evidence to their papers and to reward authors who create
artifacts. On the other hand, we want to simplify the independent replication
of results presented in the paper and to ease future comparison with existing
approaches.
