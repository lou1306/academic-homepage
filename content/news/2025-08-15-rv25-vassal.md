title: "On September 15, 2025 I will give a talk on \"Full LTL Synthesis over Infinite-state Arenas\" at the [VASSAL Workshop](https://vassal.fit.vut.cz/vassal-workshop-on-software-verification-and-runtime-analysis) in Graz, Austria."
---

The talk will present our recent [CAV paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-98685-7_13).
The workshop is co-located with [RV 2025](https://rv25.isec.tugraz.at/).
About the workshop (from its website):

> The VASSAL project is a collaboration
between Brno University of Technology (Czechia), CEA-List (France), and TU Wien
(Austria), with associated partner Honeywell (Czechia). The project focuses on
advancing the safety, security, and resilience of software systems by
integrating model-based design, formal methods, and runtime verification
techniques.  
The workshop objective is to showcase the projectâ€™s recent
scientific contributions and encourage discussions on emerging issues and
research directions in safety of verification and analysis. The workshop
program will feature invited talks from leading experts, presentations from
VASSAL researchers, and selected contributions from the runtime verification
community.
