*(From [ftfjp.github.io](https://ftfjp.github.io/)):*
The Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs (FTfJP) workshop aims to bring together people working on formal techniques and tool support for Java, or closely related languages such as C# or Scala, either with the aim to describe, analyse, and verify aspects and properties of these programming languages themselves (type systems, semantics, bytecode verification, etc.), or of programs written in these languages.
Java-like languages provide a good platform to bridge the gap between formal techniques and practical program development, because of the reasonably clear semantics and standardised libraries.

In 2002 the name of the workshop was changed slightly - from "Formal Techniques for Java Programs" to "Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs" - to include not just work on Java, but also work on related languages such as C# or Scala.
