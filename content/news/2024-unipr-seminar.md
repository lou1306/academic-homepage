Abstract of the seminar:

> Model checking is a formal technique to assess the correctness of systems by
exhaustively searching its state space for "bad" executions. If no such
execution is found, the system is safe. Otherwise, the execution is called
a counterexample and shown to the user, who may use it to debug the system (or
refine their definition of "bad"). Today, model checking is routinely used in
hardware design, and has seen increasing adoption in the software domain as
well. This required a number of theoretical breakthroughs, due to the large
state spaces that even modest programs exhibit. This seminar will provide an
overview of model checking approaches to software verification. We will start
from the basics and then discuss a few more advanced procedures that have been
devised to tackle programs with large (or infinite) state spaces. Lastly, we
show how these solutions may also enable automated reasoning on "complex
adaptive systems". These are collections of autonomous, interacting agents
which may display emergent collective behaviour (think about flocks of birds or
colonies of ants).
