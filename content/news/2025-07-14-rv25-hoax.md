title: "My paper “Execution and monitoring of HOA automata with HOAX” has been accepted to [RV 2025](https://rv25.isec.tugraz.at/) (tool track)."
---

Abstract:

> We present a tool called HOAX for the execution of ω-automata expressed
in the popular HOA format. The tool leverages the notion of trap sets to enable
runtime monitoring of any (non-parity) acceptance condition supported by the
format. When the automaton is not monitorable, the tool may still be able to
recognise so-called ugly prefixes, and determine that no further observation
will ever lead to a conclusive verdict. The tool is open-source and highly
configurable. We present its formal foundations, its design, and compare it
against the trace analyser PyContract on a lock acquisition scenario.

The tool is open-source and can be found at [https://github.com/lou1306/hoax](https://github.com/lou1306/hoax).
I am now planning to publish it on the [Python package index](https://pypi.org/)
to simplify the install process.
